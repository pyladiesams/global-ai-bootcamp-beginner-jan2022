### Workshop 3: Train and deploy a PyTorch model using the Azure Machine Learning platform.
In this workshop you are going to build and deploy your own trained vision model to a highly scalable endpoint using Azure Machine Learning.
You start with setting up your cloud workspace and learn how to manage your data and make it reusable. Next, you will train a PyTorch model using the transfer learning approach and finally you deploy the model wrapped in an API in a managed endpoint.
At the end of this workshop you have gone through the complete life-cycle of a model, from data to deployment using the Azure Machine Learning platform.

### Workshop 4: The Azure Function that can see
Who could have imagined a few years ago that you would be able to create an Azure Function that can tell you what is in your images? The good news, this is now possible with only a few lines of code and some sample images.
In this workshop you are going to train an ONNX classification Model with the Custom Vision service that will run in an Azure Function. The language of choice is Python and you will use Visual Studio Code as the editor and the Azure CLI to manage and create your Azure Resources.
At the end of the workshop you have a serverless API that can classify images and will have learned about how to use the Azure Custom Vision Python SDK to train an ONNX model.
